*** Explanation ***

This program 'ls' lists directory contents.

*******************


*** Problems to be solved ***

The -d option is not perfect yet, when you leave a blank or a '.' as an operand, it prints nothing.

The 'total #' shown under -l option is questionable. In order to show that number, 
I iterate the directory inside a while loop and count the st_blocks of each file. There 
should be a better way to implement this. Also, I haven't tested if the st_blocks is accurate 
when there is user-defined system variable BLOCKSIZE other than 512Bytes. 

Haven't implemented the -k and -h for 'total #'

In order to show non-direcoty files first than directories when there are more than one operand, I implemented
a comparator. However, this makes my printing different from the standard ls command when printing a directory
without any sorting requirement.

I believe there are much more problems remained.
