*** Explanation ***

This program 'ls' lists directory contents.

*******************


*** Problems to be solved ***

The -d option is not perfect yet, when you leave a blank or a '.' as an 
operand, it prints nothing.

The 'total #' shown under -l option is questionable. In order to show 
that number, I iterate the directory inside a while loop and count the 
st_blocks of each file. There should be a better way to implement this. 
Also, I haven't tested if the st_blocks is accurate when there is 
user-defined system variable BLOCKSIZE other than 512Bytes. 

Haven't implemented the -k and -h for 'total #'

In order to show non-direcoty files first than directories when there are more 
than one operand, I implemented a comparator. However, this makes my printing 
different from the standard ls command when printing a directory
without any sorting requirement.

I believe there are much more problems remained.


*** Updates ***

-- 11/8/2020 ---
seperate the code that print for '-l' from ls.c into print.c;
adjust the sorting method for '-la' which prints the same order as ls does
align output for '-l'

-- 11/9/2020 ---
fix the problem that cause failure when write output to pipe
implement '-s'
implement '-d'
fix the problem which cause the program to fail when encounter files that are
inaccessible, by ignoring errno when it is EACCE, it's highly inefficient but
can get the job done.
now the program will show major/minor for devices
